# Vue.js framework installation 

## Installation

Step 1: Make sure you have Node.js (LTS) installed (if not, install it from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Step 2: Install the vue-cli with 'npm install -g @vue/cli' (This will install the CLI globally so you have to do it just once)

Step 3: Run the following command to create the new folder of the project: vue create frontend

Step 4: Navigate with the arrows to 'Manually select features' and press 'Enter", then select the 2.x version

Step 5: Select 'Babel' (might be already selected), 'Router', 'Vuex', and 'Linter' by pressing space. When done, press 'Enter'

Step 6: Put 'n' for the history mode and press 'Enter'

Step 7: Select the first ESLint and press 'Enter'

Step 8: Place your config files in package.json and press 'Enter'

Step 9: Put 'n' if you don't want to save all the previous commands as a preset and press 'Enter'

Step 10: Navigate into your project: cd frontend

Step 11: Run the following command to create the 'Vuetify' plugin: vue add vuetify

Step 12: Choose the 'Default' preset

Step 13: Start the local server with this command: npm run serve

Step 14: Either enter 'http://localhost:8080/' in your browser or directly click it in your command prompt
